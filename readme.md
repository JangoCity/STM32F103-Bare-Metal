# Down the STM32 Bare Metal Rabbit Hole

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my code projects as I learn the aspects of programming an STM32F103C8 Cortex M3 microcontroller at the "bare metal" register level.  I will be creating example code for most all aspects of the ÂµC including SPI, USART, I2C, DMA, etc.
